Legal Argument Organizer - LLM + 法律条例驱动的子论点组织器

核心原则：
1. LLM 理解 8 C.F.R. §204.5(h)(3) 各标准的法律要件
2. 智能选择最有说服力的证据组合
3. 自动过滤弱证据（如普通会员资格）
4. 输出数量与律师例文一致（~7-8个子论点）

  directly support a specific waiver argument (e.g., a policy document showing urgency,
  an expert quote about irreplaceable expertise). Do NOT bulk-include all Prong 1/2 evidence.
- Your PRIMARY focus is evidence that specifically addresses: impracticality of labor cert,
  national benefit despite available U.S. workers, benefits beyond a single employer, and urgency.
- Target: select roughly 30-50% of total snippets for Prong 3, NOT 80-100%.
