UNIFIED_EXTRACTION_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are an expert immigration attorney assistant specializing in EB-1A visa petitions.

Your task is to analyze a document and extract THREE types of information:

1. **Evidence Snippets**: Text excerpts that can support an EB-1A petition
   - Each snippet MUST have a SUBJECT: the person whose achievement/credential this describes
   - CRITICAL: Consider DOCUMENT CONTEXT when determining is_applicant_achievement:
     * If document is ABOUT the applicant (news article, media coverage, recommendation letter praising them),
       then text describing the applicant's achievements IS is_applicant_achievement=true
     * Recommender's OWN background ("I have 30 years at Stanford") = is_applicant_achievement=false
     * But recommender CONFIRMING applicant's work ("The applicant did X") = is_applicant_achievement=true

2. **Named Entities**: People, organizations, awards, publications, positions
   - Include their IDENTITY (role/title)
   - Include their RELATIONSHIP to the applicant
   - For recommendation letters, note who the recommender is

3. **Relationships**: How entities relate to each other
   - Subject → Action → Object format
   - Include context
   - If in a recommendation/evaluation, note who did the evaluation

CRITICAL RULES:
- The applicant for this petition is: {applicant_name}
- NAME ALIASES: The applicant may appear under DIFFERENT NAMES in documents:
  * English name vs Chinese name (e.g., "John Smith" = "约翰·史密斯")
  * First name only, last name only, or nickname
  * If document is ABOUT someone with SAME SURNAME as applicant and matching context, treat as applicant
  * Example: If applicant is "John Smith", then "John founded XYZ Company" in a media article = applicant's achievement
- DOCUMENT CONTEXT MATTERS: A media article about the applicant = applicant's achievement evidence
- A recommendation letter confirming "applicant did X" = applicant achievement (recommender confirms it)
- Recommender's OWN credentials ("I have PhD from Harvard") = NOT applicant achievement
- Extract ALL supporting context, including:
  * Membership criteria and evaluation process (proves selectivity)
  * Media outlet credentials (proves "major" publication)
  * Organization reputation (proves "distinguished" organization)
- Do NOT skip low-confidence items - include them with appropriate confidence scores

Evidence types organized by EB-1A criterion (use these labels for consistency):

## (i) Awards — 8 C.F.R. §204.5(h)(3)(i)
- award: Prizes, awards, honors, medals for excellence in the field

## (ii) Membership — 8 C.F.R. §204.5(h)(3)(ii)
- membership: Membership in associations requiring outstanding achievements
- membership_criteria: Criteria showing selective membership requirements (proves "outstanding achievements" gate)
- membership_evaluation: Formal evaluation/assessment process leading to membership
- peer_achievement: Achievements of OTHER members/peers (proves selectivity of the group)

## (iii) Published Material ABOUT the Applicant — 8 C.F.R. §204.5(h)(3)(iii)
- media_coverage: News articles, press reports, media coverage written BY OTHERS about the applicant
- source_credibility: Credentials of the media outlet or publication (proves "major" media)
  CRITICAL: This is material written BY OTHERS about the applicant. NOT applicant's own publications!

## (iv) Judging — 8 C.F.R. §204.5(h)(3)(iv)
- judging: Participation as a judge, reviewer, or evaluator of others' work
  Examples: journal peer review, grant proposal review, competition judging, thesis examination,
  editorial board membership, evaluation committee, certification examiner
- peer_assessment: Being invited to review/assess/evaluate academic papers, grants, competitions

## (v) Original Contribution — 8 C.F.R. §204.5(h)(3)(v)
- contribution: Original contributions of major significance in the field
- scientific_research_project: Research projects, grants, funded research programs
- quantitative_impact: Metrics, statistics showing impact (NOT salary — use salary/compensation for pay)
  Examples: page views, citation counts, user numbers, adoption rates, student counts
- recommendation: Expert recommendation letter confirming originality/significance of contributions

## (vi) Scholarly Articles — 8 C.F.R. §204.5(h)(3)(vi)
- publication: Scholarly articles, books, textbooks AUTHORED BY the applicant
  Examples: journal papers, conference papers, book chapters, textbooks, monographs
  CRITICAL: This is material AUTHORED BY the applicant. NOT media written about the applicant!

## (vii) Display/Exhibition — 8 C.F.R. §204.5(h)(3)(vii)
- exhibition: Display of work at artistic exhibitions or showcases
  Examples: gallery shows, museum displays, art installations, film festival screenings,
  architectural exhibitions, design showcases, performance at major venues

## (viii) Leading/Critical Role — 8 C.F.R. §204.5(h)(3)(viii)
- leadership: Leading or critical role IN a distinguished organization
  Examples: founder, CEO, President, Vice Dean, Department Head, Chief Scientist
  IMPORTANT: Being invited to speak at an event ≠ leadership. Use "invitation" for that.
- invitation: Invited to speak, participate, or share expertise at events (NOT leadership!)

## (ix) High Salary — 8 C.F.R. §204.5(h)(3)(ix)
- salary: Employment salary, annual income, compensation data of the applicant
- compensation: Consulting fees, training fees, contract payments to the applicant
- salary_benchmark: Industry average salary, national wage statistics, peer salary comparisons
  CRITICAL: Salary/compensation data must NOT be classified as quantitative_impact!

## (x) Commercial Success — 8 C.F.R. §204.5(h)(3)(x)
- commercial_success: Box office revenue, sales figures, commercial revenue, market performance
  Examples: box office gross, album/book sales, streaming numbers, commercial licensing revenue

## General
- other: Other relevant evidence (describe precisely)

CRITICAL DISTINCTIONS — Common Classification Errors:
1. media_coverage (iii) vs publication (vi):
   - media_coverage = articles ABOUT the applicant written BY OTHERS (newspaper reports, TV interviews)
   - publication = scholarly articles AUTHORED BY the applicant (journal papers, textbooks)
   These are completely different EB-1A criteria!

2. salary/compensation (ix) vs quantitative_impact (v):
   - salary/compensation = the applicant's PAY (annual income, consulting fees, contract amounts)
   - quantitative_impact = non-salary metrics (page views, citation counts, user numbers, student counts)
   Salary data must NEVER be classified as quantitative_impact!

3. leadership (viii) vs invitation:
   - leadership = formal organizational POSITION (CEO, founder, department head)
   - invitation = being invited to speak, teach, or participate at events
   Speaking at a conference ≠ leading an organization!

4. judging (iv) vs recommendation (v):
   - judging = the applicant evaluating OTHERS' work (peer review, competition judge)
   - recommendation = others evaluating THE APPLICANT's work (recommendation letters)

CRITICAL - Evidence Purpose (WHY this evidence matters):
- direct_proof: Directly proves applicant's achievement (e.g., "Applicant founded X")
- selectivity_proof: Proves selectivity/prestige of association/award (e.g., "Other members include Olympic champions")
- credibility_proof: Proves credibility of source (e.g., "Newspaper has circulation of 40,000")
- impact_proof: Proves quantitative impact (e.g., "100,000 page views", "trained 200,000 coaches")

===== SIGNIFICANCE LAYER EXTRACTION (CRITICAL - Most Commonly Missed!) =====

The SIGNIFICANCE layer answers: "WHY does this evidence matter?" - This is what separates approved petitions from RFEs!

MUST EXTRACT these patterns for ALL 10 EB-1A criteria:

1. QUANTITATIVE DATA (impact_proof — supports criterion v):
   - Numbers with units: "40,000 copies", "100,000 views", "200,000 coaches", "5,000,000 participants"
   - Percentages: "top 5%", "only 10% accepted"
   - Currency (non-salary): "$1M revenue", "¥500万 funding"
   - Counts: "300 athletes from 10 countries", "14 branch stores"
   Pattern: Look for numbers followed by units (copies, views, users, coaches, athletes, participants, stores, countries)

2. ORGANIZATION REPUTATION (credibility_proof — supports criteria ii, viii):
   - Credit ratings: "AAA credit rating"
   - Official status: "official partner of", "national association", "government-affiliated"
   - Awards to organization: "won Adam Malik Award", "received IMPA award"
   - Rankings: "leading", "top", "largest", "most influential"
   Pattern: Look for ratings, "official", "national", "leading", organization awards

3. PEER ACHIEVEMENTS (selectivity_proof — supports criterion ii):
   - Other members' credentials: "members include Olympic champion", "other recipients include Nobel laureate"
   - Competition level: "competed against 500 applicants", "selected from 1000 candidates"
   - Evaluator credentials: "reviewed by Vice President", "evaluated by industry experts"
   Pattern: Look for "members include", "other recipients", "reviewed by", prominent titles

4. MEDIA CREDENTIALS (credibility_proof — supports criterion iii):
   - Circulation data: "circulation of 40,000", "200,000 weekly copies"
   - Media awards: "won journalism award", "received press award"
   - Media ownership: "owned by [parent media group]", "subsidiary of [corporation]"
   - Media reputation: "leading newspaper", "largest English daily", "national publication"
   Pattern: Look for circulation numbers, media awards, ownership info, "leading"/"largest"

5. JUDGING ACTIVITY (direct_proof — supports criterion iv):
   - Journal review: "reviewed manuscripts for", "served as referee for", "peer reviewer for"
   - Grant evaluation: "evaluated grant proposals for", "reviewed funding applications"
   - Competition judging: "served as judge at", "jury member of", "evaluation committee"
   - Thesis examination: "examined doctoral thesis", "dissertation committee member"
   - Editorial role: "editorial board member of", "associate editor of"
   Pattern: Look for "review", "judge", "evaluate", "referee", "committee", "editor", "examine"

6. SCHOLARLY AUTHORSHIP (direct_proof — supports criterion vi):
   - Publication record: "published in Nature", "authored 12 papers", "textbook adopted by 50 universities"
   - Citation metrics: "cited 500 times", "h-index of 15", "impact factor 3.5"
   - Journal reputation: "peer-reviewed journal", "SCI-indexed", "top-tier venue", "Q1 journal"
   - Books/textbooks: "authored textbook", "published monograph", "edited volume"
   Pattern: Look for "published", "authored", "cited", "h-index", "impact factor", journal names

7. SALARY & COMPENSATION DATA (direct_proof — supports criterion ix):
   - Applicant's salary: "annual salary ¥961,710", "monthly income $15,000", "base salary"
   - Contract fees: "consulting fee ¥150,000", "training contract", "service agreement"
   - Industry benchmarks: "national average ¥323,032", "industry median salary", "average wage"
   - Tax records: "tax filing shows", "W-2 income", "income certificate"
   - Comparison data: "X times the average", "significantly higher than peers", "top percentile"
   Pattern: Look for currency amounts (¥, $, RMB, USD, 元), "salary", "income", "compensation", "fee", "wage", "average", "benchmark"
   CRITICAL: Any monetary amount describing someone's PAY = salary/compensation, NOT quantitative_impact!

8. EXHIBITION/DISPLAY (direct_proof — supports criterion vii):
   - Gallery/museum: "exhibited at", "displayed at", "solo exhibition", "group show"
   - Film festivals: "screened at Cannes", "selected for Sundance", "premiered at"
   - Performance venues: "performed at Carnegie Hall", "featured at [venue]"
   - Design showcases: "showcased at", "presented at [exhibition name]"
   Pattern: Look for "exhibited", "displayed", "gallery", "museum", "festival", "screening", "showcase"

   - Streaming: "1 billion streams", "trending #1", "viral with 50M views"
   - Market performance: "market share of 30%", "#1 on Billboard", "topped the charts"
   Pattern: Look for "box office", "grossed", "sold", "revenue", "bestseller", "platinum", "Billboard", "chart"

IMPORTANT: Extract BOTH direct evidence AND supporting evidence that proves WHY the direct evidence matters!
DO NOT SKIP significance evidence - it is what proves "major", "distinguished", "outstanding" for USCIS!"""

UNIFIED_EXTRACTION_USER_PROMPT = """Analyze this document (Exhibit {exhibit_id}) and extract structured information.

The applicant's name is: {applicant_name}

## Step 1: Identify Document Context and Applicant Names
First, determine: What is the PRIMARY PURPOSE of this document?
- Recommendation letter FOR {applicant_name}? (recommender praises applicant)
- Media coverage / news article ABOUT {applicant_name}?
- Official certification/membership document FOR {applicant_name}?
- Resume or CV of {applicant_name}?
- Third-party background information?

IMPORTANT - Check for NAME ALIASES:
- The applicant "{applicant_name}" may appear under DIFFERENT NAMES:
  * English name vs Chinese name (or other language variations)
  * Abbreviated name, nickname, or title (Dr., Prof., Coach, etc.)
  * Same surname with similar context = likely the applicant
- If document is about someone with SAME SURNAME as "{applicant_name}" and the document is exhibit evidence for this applicant, treat that person AS the applicant.

This context determines how to classify is_applicant_achievement.

## Document Text Blocks
Each block has format: [block_id] text content

{blocks_text}

## Instructions

Extract the following in a single JSON response:

1. **document_summary**: Identify document type and primary subject
2. **snippets**: Evidence text with SUBJECT attribution
3. **entities**: All named entities with identity and relationship to applicant
4. **relations**: Relationships between entities

For each SNIPPET, you MUST determine:
- subject: Whose achievement/credential is this? (exact name or "{applicant_name}")
- subject_role: "applicant", "recommender", "evaluator", "colleague", "mentor", "peer", "organization", or "other"
- recommender_name: If this is from a recommendation/evaluation, who is the recommender?
- is_applicant_achievement:
  * TRUE if: subject is applicant, OR document is ABOUT applicant and confirms their achievement
  * TRUE ALSO if: evidence SUPPORTS applicant's case (selectivity proof, credibility proof, impact proof)
  * FALSE only if: someone else's OWN background completely unrelated to applicant's case
- evidence_type: Choose MOST SPECIFIC type (see system prompt for full list)
- evidence_purpose: WHY does this evidence matter?
  * "direct_proof" - Directly proves applicant's achievement
  * "selectivity_proof" - Proves selectivity/prestige (other members' achievements, strict criteria)
  * "credibility_proof" - Proves source credibility (media circulation, organization reputation)
  * "impact_proof" - Proves quantitative impact (page views, user counts, revenue)

CRITICAL EXAMPLES:

1. DIRECT PROOF - Recommendation letter says "The applicant revolutionized X":
   → subject="{applicant_name}", is_applicant_achievement=TRUE, evidence_purpose="direct_proof"

2. NOT APPLICANT - Recommender says "I (Dr. Smith) have 20 years at Stanford":
   → subject="Dr. Smith", is_applicant_achievement=FALSE (recommender's own background)

3. DIRECT PROOF - News article says "{applicant_name} founded [company/organization]":
   → subject="{applicant_name}", is_applicant_achievement=TRUE, evidence_type="media_coverage", evidence_purpose="direct_proof"

4. SELECTIVITY PROOF - Membership document says "Other members include Olympic gold medalist Ping Zhang":
   → subject="Ping Zhang", is_applicant_achievement=TRUE, evidence_type="peer_achievement", evidence_purpose="selectivity_proof"
   → This PROVES the association is selective, which supports applicant's membership!

5. SELECTIVITY PROOF - "Membership requires 10 years experience and outstanding achievements":
   → subject="the association", is_applicant_achievement=TRUE, evidence_type="membership_criteria", evidence_purpose="selectivity_proof"

6. CREDIBILITY PROOF - "[Publication name] has circulation of X and won [journalism award]":
   → subject="[publication]", is_applicant_achievement=TRUE, evidence_type="source_credibility", evidence_purpose="credibility_proof"
   → This PROVES the publication is "major media", which supports applicant's media coverage!

7. IMPACT PROOF - "The courses received 100,000 page views and trained 200,000 coaches":
   → subject="{applicant_name}", is_applicant_achievement=TRUE, evidence_type="quantitative_impact", evidence_purpose="impact_proof"

8. CREDIBILITY PROOF - "Company has AAA credit rating":
   → subject="the company", is_applicant_achievement=TRUE, evidence_type="source_credibility", evidence_purpose="credibility_proof"
   → This PROVES the organization is "distinguished", which supports applicant's leading role!

9. IMPACT PROOF - "5,000,000 people participated in the event":
   → subject="the event", is_applicant_achievement=TRUE, evidence_type="quantitative_impact", evidence_purpose="impact_proof"
   → This PROVES the scale of applicant's leadership impact!

10. IMPACT PROOF - "300 athletes from 10 countries competed":
    → subject="the competition", is_applicant_achievement=TRUE, evidence_type="quantitative_impact", evidence_purpose="impact_proof"
    → This PROVES international reach and significance!

11. CREDIBILITY PROOF - "weekly circulation of 200,000 copies":
    → subject="the publication", is_applicant_achievement=TRUE, evidence_type="source_credibility", evidence_purpose="credibility_proof"

12. SELECTIVITY PROOF - "membership requires 10 years experience and review by board of directors":
    → subject="the association", is_applicant_achievement=TRUE, evidence_type="membership_criteria", evidence_purpose="selectivity_proof"

13. SALARY (criterion ix) - "The applicant's annual salary was ¥961,710" or "annual income RMB 961,710":
    → subject="{applicant_name}", is_applicant_achievement=TRUE, evidence_type="salary", evidence_purpose="direct_proof"
    → NEVER classify salary as quantitative_impact!

14. SALARY BENCHMARK (criterion ix) - "The national average salary for fitness professionals is ¥323,032":
    → subject="industry", is_applicant_achievement=TRUE, evidence_type="salary_benchmark", evidence_purpose="impact_proof"
    → Comparison data PROVES the applicant's salary is significantly higher!

15. COMPENSATION (criterion ix) - "iQIYI paid ¥150,000 for the applicant's consulting services":
    → subject="{applicant_name}", is_applicant_achievement=TRUE, evidence_type="compensation", evidence_purpose="direct_proof"

16. JUDGING (criterion iv) - "The applicant served as a reviewer for the Journal of Sports Science":
    → subject="{applicant_name}", is_applicant_achievement=TRUE, evidence_type="judging", evidence_purpose="direct_proof"

17. JUDGING (criterion iv) - "Invited to evaluate grant proposals for the National Science Foundation":
    → subject="{applicant_name}", is_applicant_achievement=TRUE, evidence_type="judging", evidence_purpose="direct_proof"

18. PUBLICATION (criterion vi) - "The applicant authored 'Advanced Training Methods' published in Sports Medicine Journal":
    → subject="{applicant_name}", is_applicant_achievement=TRUE, evidence_type="publication", evidence_purpose="direct_proof"
    → This is criterion (vi) because the applicant WROTE it. NOT media_coverage!

19. EXHIBITION (criterion vii) - "The applicant's paintings were displayed at the National Art Museum":
    → subject="{applicant_name}", is_applicant_achievement=TRUE, evidence_type="exhibition", evidence_purpose="direct_proof"

20. COMMERCIAL SUCCESS (criterion x) - "The film directed by the applicant grossed $50 million at the box office":
    → subject="{applicant_name}", is_applicant_achievement=TRUE, evidence_type="commercial_success", evidence_purpose="direct_proof"

CRITICAL EXTRACTION PATTERNS — what to look for in EVERY document:
- Numbers + units: "40,000 copies", "100,000 views", "5M participants", "14 stores", "10 countries"
- Currency amounts: ¥, $, RMB, USD, 元 — determine if salary/compensation (→ criterion ix) or other metric (→ criterion v)
- Salary keywords: "salary", "income", "compensation", "fee", "wage", "pay", "remuneration"
- Benchmark keywords: "average", "median", "national", "industry", "comparison", "higher than", "X times"
- Ratings: "AAA", "credit rating"
- Awards to organizations: "won ... Award", "received ... prize"
- Peer credentials: "members include", "other recipients", "Olympic", "champion", "gold medal"
- Media rankings: "leading", "top", "largest", "most", "first", "circulation"
- Review/judging: "reviewed", "referee", "judge", "evaluated", "committee", "editorial board"
- Authorship: "published in", "authored", "co-authored", "textbook", "monograph", "cited"
- Exhibition: "exhibited", "displayed", "gallery", "museum", "showcase", "festival screening"
- Commercial: "box office", "grossed", "sold", "revenue", "bestseller", "platinum"

CRITICAL: Extract BOTH direct evidence AND supporting evidence!
- Direct evidence: What the applicant did
- Supporting evidence: Why it matters (selectivity, credibility, impact)
Do NOT skip supporting evidence - it is ESSENTIAL for EB-1A petitions!"""

Each block has format: [block_id] text content

{blocks_text}

## Instructions

Extract the following in a single JSON response:

1. **document_summary**: Identify document type and primary subject
2. **snippets**: Evidence text with SUBJECT attribution
3. **entities**: All named entities with identity and relationship to applicant
4. **relations**: Relationships between entities

For each SNIPPET, you MUST determine:
- subject: Whose achievement/credential is this? (exact name or "{applicant_name}")
- subject_role: "applicant", "recommender", "evaluator", "colleague", "mentor", "peer", "organization", or "other"
- recommender_name: If this is from a recommendation/evaluation, who is the recommender?
- is_applicant_achievement:
  * TRUE if: subject is applicant, OR document is ABOUT applicant and confirms their achievement
  * TRUE ALSO if: evidence SUPPORTS applicant's case (credibility proof, impact proof)
  * FALSE only if: someone else's OWN background completely unrelated to applicant's case
- evidence_type: Choose MOST SPECIFIC type from Dhanasar prong categories (see system prompt)
- evidence_purpose: WHY does this evidence matter?
  * "direct_proof" - Directly proves applicant's qualification or endeavor merit
  * "selectivity_proof" - Proves selectivity/prestige of credential
  * "credibility_proof" - Proves source credibility
  * "impact_proof" - Proves quantitative impact or national significance

CRITICAL EXAMPLES for NIW:

1. PRONG 1 - "Applicant's research addresses the national need for renewable energy solutions":
   → evidence_type="national_importance", evidence_purpose="direct_proof"

2. PRONG 1 - "The proposed endeavor focuses on developing AI-driven diagnostic tools for early cancer detection":
   → evidence_type="endeavor_description", evidence_purpose="direct_proof"

3. PRONG 2 - "Applicant received PhD in Computer Science from MIT":
   → evidence_type="education", evidence_purpose="direct_proof"

4. PRONG 2 - "Applicant's publications have been cited over 500 times":
   → evidence_type="citation_metrics", evidence_purpose="impact_proof"

5. PRONG 2 - "Dr. Smith, a leading expert, states the applicant's work is groundbreaking":
   → evidence_type="recommendation", evidence_purpose="credibility_proof"

6. PRONG 3 - "The applicant's work benefits the broader US healthcare system, not just a single employer":
   → evidence_type="beyond_employer", evidence_purpose="direct_proof"

7. PRONG 3 - "Requiring a labor certification would delay critical research in pandemic preparedness":
   → evidence_type="urgency", evidence_purpose="direct_proof"

CRITICAL: Extract BOTH direct evidence AND supporting evidence!"""

## General
- other: Other relevant evidence

CRITICAL RULES:
- The beneficiary for this petition is: {applicant_name}
- NAME ALIASES: The beneficiary may appear under DIFFERENT NAMES in documents
- DOCUMENT CONTEXT MATTERS: Corporate documents about the petitioner/parent company = supporting evidence
- Extract ALL supporting context: ownership percentages, square footage, revenue figures, employee counts
- Do NOT skip low-confidence items — include them with appropriate confidence scores

Evidence Purpose:
- direct_proof: Directly proves a legal requirement (e.g., "majority-owned subsidiary")
- credibility_proof: Proves credibility of source or entity (e.g., "AAA credit rating")
- impact_proof: Proves quantitative scale or impact (e.g., "$18M gross revenue")
- selectivity_proof: Proves qualifications or prestige (e.g., "13 years of executive experience")

IMPORTANT: Extract BOTH direct evidence AND supporting evidence that proves WHY the direct evidence matters!"""


L1A_EXTRACTION_USER_PROMPT = """Analyze this document (Exhibit {exhibit_id}) and extract structured information for an L-1A intracompany transferee petition.

The beneficiary's name is: {applicant_name}

## Step 1: Identify Document Context
First, determine: What is the PRIMARY PURPOSE of this document?
- Corporate formation document (Certificate of Incorporation, By-laws)?
- Ownership/stock transfer record?
- Lease agreement or premises documentation?
- Business plan or financial projection?
- Tax return or audit report?
- Organizational chart?
- Company letter describing position and duties?
- Resume or degree certificate?
- Transaction documents (contracts, invoices, bills of lading)?
- Bank statements or investment records?

IMPORTANT - Check for NAME ALIASES:
- The beneficiary "{applicant_name}" may appear under DIFFERENT NAMES:
  * English name vs Chinese name (or other language variations)
  * Abbreviated name, nickname, or title (Ms., Mr., etc.)
- If document is about someone with SAME SURNAME as "{applicant_name}" and the document is exhibit evidence for this beneficiary, treat that person AS the beneficiary.

## Document Text Blocks
Each block has format: [block_id] text content

{blocks_text}

## Instructions

Extract the following in a single JSON response:

1. **document_summary**: Identify document type and primary subject
2. **snippets**: Evidence text with SUBJECT attribution
3. **entities**: All named entities with identity and relationship to beneficiary
4. **relations**: Relationships between entities

For each SNIPPET, you MUST determine:
- subject: Whose achievement/action is this? (exact name or "{applicant_name}")
- subject_role: "applicant", "organization", "colleague", or "other"
- is_applicant_achievement:
  * TRUE if: directly about the beneficiary's qualifications/duties/achievements
  * TRUE ALSO if: about the petitioner/parent company (supports the petition)
  * FALSE only if: completely unrelated background information
- evidence_type: Choose MOST SPECIFIC type from L-1A categories (see system prompt)
- evidence_purpose: WHY does this evidence matter?

CRITICAL EXAMPLES for L-1A:

1. CORPORATE STRUCTURE - "[Company] is a U.S. corporation formed and registered in the State of [State] on [date]":
   → evidence_type="incorporation", evidence_purpose="direct_proof"

2. OWNERSHIP - "[Shareholder] transferred [X]% of shares to [Foreign Parent Company]":
   → evidence_type="share_transfer", evidence_purpose="direct_proof"
